# üß† AI Assistant Prompt Template ‚Äî Mass Shadow Calculation System

You are a full-stack AI engineer helping me build a scalable system for calculating shadows cast by buildings using solar data. I already have a working mathematical model (in JavaScript) that:

- Calculates the sun‚Äôs direction vector using azimuth + elevation
- Generates a 3D shadow volume from a building mesh
- Cuts that volume against nearby buildings to detect affected area/volume

I want you to turn this into a **production-ready system** with the following:

---

## üõ†Ô∏è TASKS

### ‚úÖ 1. Convert Shadow Logic to Backend API
- Migrate JS logic to **Python (FastAPI)** or **Node.js (Express)**.
- Expose an endpoint like:

  ```
  POST /api/shadow/calculate
  {
    "buildings": [...],       // 3D geometry or bounding boxes
    "location": [lat, lng],
    "timestamp": "2025-06-21T12:00:00Z"
  }
  ```

- Output:
  - Shadow volumes
  - Affected building IDs
  - Surface area and volume affected
  - Optional: shadow geometry (for visualization)

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Use pvlib or Similar for Sun Position
- Integrate `pvlib` to get accurate solar azimuth and elevation.

---

### ‚úÖ 3. Optimize for Performance
- Use low-poly building approximations (e.g. extruded footprints).
- Allow 1,000+ buildings per request using:
  - `multiprocessing` or `Dask` (Python)
  - Web workers or clustered server threads (Node.js)

---

### ‚úÖ 4. Storage
- Store input and output in **PostGIS** or **MongoDB**.
- Enable spatial queries like:
  ```
  Get all buildings affected between 10 AM and 2 PM on June 21
  ```

---

### ‚úÖ 5. Build a Frontend UI
- Tech stack: **React + Three.js** (or Next.js)
- Features:
  - Upload building data (GeoJSON or STL)
  - Select time, date, and location
  - View buildings, shadows, and affected zones in 3D
  - Download results (JSON or map screenshot)

---

### ‚úÖ 6. Deployment
- Containerize with **Docker**
- Deploy on:
  - **Render.com** (simple)
  - **AWS (Lambda/ECS)** or **Google Cloud Run**
- Add caching for repeated queries

---

### ‚úÖ 7. Documentation
- Auto-generate OpenAPI/Swagger docs for the backend.
- Add README.md and setup scripts for easy installation.

---

## üí° EXTRAS (Optional but Useful)
- Support time series (e.g. hourly shadow simulation for a full day)
- Add solar exposure percentage per building
- Support importing OSM data via `osmnx`

---

## ‚úÖ INPUT MATERIALS
You can assume:
- JS logic is complete and includes `sun vector ‚Üí shadow extrusion ‚Üí boolean cut`.
- Building geometries will be simplified boxes or polygons with height.
